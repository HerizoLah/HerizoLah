## Hi there 👋

<!--
**HerizoLah/HerizoLah** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar. My research focuses on conservation economics and the socio economic impacts of protected areas, with a particular interest in Conservation Basic Income as a policy approach to reduce deforestation and support local livelihoods around Masoala National Park.

I currently work on household survey data, contingent valuation methods, and quantitative and qualitative analysis related to willingness to accept compensation for conservation restrictions. I am interested in collaboration on conservation finance, impact evaluation, and applied socio economic research.
